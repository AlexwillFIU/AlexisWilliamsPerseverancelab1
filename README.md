# ModelTemplate
A basic template for expanding to use in the Systems Analysis and Design class.

Please use this if you are enrolled in my Systems Analysis and Design class. I may be adding more classes and interfaces to this template as time goes on. You should fork this template and create your own project. All changes will be (hopefully) backward compatible so you can merge in future changes in your projects if needed.

This is likely not going to be useful for anyone not enrolled in my Systems analysis and design course.
